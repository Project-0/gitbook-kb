# How to document the recusion

The short answer is: journaling.  What we want to accomplish is the ability to _see_, from a heuristic perspective, the evolution of a process
by throughly documenting everything that we do.  We want to create a knowledgebase from which to draw and the easiest way to do that is to
record in some place where it can be mined.  Given that version control software has built-in temporal tracking, it seems a good fit.

So, any time you make a change, branch/fork/clone as appropriate, make your change and submit it back, just include the throught process.
